    "Although its name may sound harmless, Linear Algebra is by no means a trivial branch of mathematics, and the deeper you dive into Data Science and Statistics, the more often you will encounter its concepts.

    "## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n",
    "No discussion of Linear Algebra would be complete without taking a look at Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.  The root word \"eigen\" comes from the German meaning \"characteristic\", and these values and associated vectors, represent some interesting properties of a given matrix.  Namely, for a given matrix $\\textbf{A}$ and vector $\\vec{v}$, the eigenvalue(s), $\\lambda$, of $\\textbf{A}$, are the $\\lambda$ that satisfy the relationship $$\\textbf{A} \\vec{v} = \\lambda \\vec{v}$$ Keep in mind that $\\lambda$ is a *scalar* quantity, and when you multiply a vector by a scalar quantity, you just scale, or stretch, the vector in space.  Therefore, the above relationship says that the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\textbf{A}$, and associated eigenvectors $\\vec{v}$, are the vectors that when multiplied by $\\textbf{A}$ just \"stretch\" in space (no rotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that may not sound very special, but the applicability of these concepts cannot be understated.  Eigenvalues and vectors have a tendency to crop up in any mathematically grounded discipline and Data Science is no exception.\n",

    "## Matrix Decomposition\n",
    "Matrix Decomposition can be thought of as rewriting a given matrix as a product of other (and often simpler) matrices.  For example, given a matrix $\\textbf{A}$, one can decompose $\\textbf{A}$ into the following. $$\\textbf{A} = \\textbf{Q} \\Lambda \\textbf{Q}^{-1}$$\n",
    "where $\\textbf{Q}$ is a matrix whose *$i^{th}$* column is the *$i^{th}$* eigenvector of $\\textbf{A}$, and $\\Lambda$ is a matrix containing all of the corresponding eigenvalues on the main diagonal.  Decomposing $\\textbf{A}$ in this manner is called an Eigendecomposition.  Such matrix decompositions, form the basis of many techniques in Data Science and other mathematical disciplines."

    "1. Construct a set of three vectors $\\vec{\\lambda_1} \\dots \\vec{\\lambda_n}$, whose *$n^{th}$* element is the *$n^{th}$* eigenvalue of $\\textbf{A}$ while all other elements are 0.  The second vector, for example, would be $$\\vec{\\lambda_2} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\lambda_2 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

    "1. Solve the relationship you found in part (4) for $\\textbf{A}$ and verify that this is the eigenvalue decomposition.\n",
    "1. Another very useful matrix decomposition is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which is used, for example, in Principal Component Analysis.  A full discussion of this decomposition is beyond the scope of this exercise, but singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $\\textbf{A}\\textbf{A}^T$ (for the real case).  Using numpy, perform a SVD on $\\textbf{A}$ used above, and verify that the values on the main diagonal of the singular matrix are the square roots of the eigenvalues of $\\textbf{A}$."
